# How to contribute

MinusX is open source. From the very beginning, we've felt that MinusX could be extended to many more use-cases than we could ever build ourselves. The MinusX architecture reflects this as we've designed it to be easy to add support to new apps.

The analogy of retrofitting is apt here as what MinusX does at its core is to retrofit your existing apps with AI capabilities. We believe that in the future, the power of LLMs will enable more people to augment existing software in ways their creators never imagined and we intend MinusX to be a part of that future.

Development is coordinated through [Discord](https://minusx.ai/discord) and GitHub.

Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://minusx.ai/discord) to get started.

We'll be adding more detailed examples and posts on how to add more tools and upstream them, soon!
