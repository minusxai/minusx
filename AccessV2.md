# Access V2 — Groups, Folder Permissions, and SQL-Enforced Access

Status: **design, pre-implementation.** This documents the target model and the phased path to it. No behavior changes until Phase 3.

## Why

Today access has two axes:

- **Role** (`admin` / `editor` / `viewer`) → *what kinds of files* you may touch and how (`rules.json`: allowed / create / view types).
- **`home_folder`** (one relative path per user) → *where*. Non-admins can read/create/delete only under that prefix (plus their own conversations); admins get everything in the mode.

Two gaps:
1. **One folder per user.** No way to give a user access to several areas, or to share an area across a team.
2. **Scope implies write.** If a path is in your scope you can edit and delete in it. There's no way to express the most common arrangement — *many people can view this folder, a few can edit it.*

## The model

**Roles become groups. Add groups. Keep the home folder.**

- A **group** = a **capability profile** + a set of **folder scopes** + members.
  - **Capability profile** — the type/verb matrix (today's `rules.json` shape). Chosen from a **preset**: `View` (read-only types), `Build` (create/edit analytics types), `Full` (build + manage connections/contexts + delete). The raw matrix is an "advanced" escape hatch.
  - **Folder scopes** — a list of folders the profile applies to. Grants **cascade to subfolders** (prefix match). Stored mode-relative (like `home_folder`), resolved per mode at runtime.
  - Membership is plain — a group's meaning lives in the group, not the membership.
- **Seed groups** map 1:1 from today's roles, so migration is behavior-identical:
  - `Admin` — a **special, locked group**: capabilities `*`, scope `*`, plus workspace-admin (below). Only membership is editable.
  - `Editor` — today's editor types, scope = the member's home folder.
  - `Viewer` — today's viewer types, scope = the member's home folder.
- **`home_folder` stays** a per-user attribute and personal space. Internally it's an intrinsic grant (`Editor`/`Viewer` reference it as a symbolic scope); the group system is purely additive on top.

**Effective access = union across a user's groups of `(capability ∩ scope)`, plus intrinsic grants (home folder, own conversations).**

- The **per-group intersection** is load-bearing: a user in `Viewer` (read-only) plus `Finance-Editors` (edit on `/finance`) edits in finance and only views elsewhere — a *global* union of capabilities would wrongly grant edit everywhere.
- **Union only — no deny rules.** Most-permissive grant wins. Deny/precedence is where permission systems become unexplainable.
- "Many view, few edit" = two groups over the same folder (`Finance-Viewers`, `Finance-Editors`). The group name *is* the permission. (Mixed levels within one group is deferred — an additive change if ever needed.)

**Workspace-admin actions** (LLM settings, DB import/export, user management — the ~26 admin-only endpoints) are **not** file access. They stay a coarse in-endpoint check (`is the user in an admin-capable group?`), read from the token like `role` is today. Only the fine-grained folder scopes are resolved live (below).

## Enforcement — compiled to SQL

All **file access** is enforced in the query, not in application code. The scattered JS checks (`canAccessFile` and its call sites) are deleted; the permission decision becomes a single SQL predicate over `(files.type, files.path)` and the caller's live group set:

```
admin                                                            -- OR
OR ( path LIKE '/<mode>/%'                                       -- mode isolation
     AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM group_members m JOIN groups g …  -- union of groups
                  WHERE m.user_id = <caller>
                    AND files.type = ANY(g.types)                --   capability ∩
                    AND (files.path = g.folder
                         OR files.path LIKE g.folder||'/%') ) )  --   scope (prefix)
OR path LIKE '/<mode>/…/<caller home or conversations>/%'        -- intrinsic grants
```

Every operation compiles; "0 rows" = denied:
- **Read / edit / delete** — predicate in `WHERE`.
- **Create** — `INSERT … SELECT <values> WHERE <predicate over the new path+type>`; nothing selected → nothing inserted → denied.
- **Move** — one `WHERE` checks the old path (row) and new path (param) together.

Fine-grained scopes are a **live join** in the query (not the token), so adding a user to a group, or a folder to a group, takes effect immediately — no re-login. (The coarse admin flag can live in the token, like `role` today.)

### Transparent enforcement via RLS

The same predicate is installed as a **Postgres Row-Level Security policy** on `files`, so the database itself refuses unauthorized rows regardless of the SQL a caller runs — defense in depth, and enforcement can't be forgotten.

- **Verified to work on both PGLite and Postgres** (the two backends this app supports). Mechanism: a non-superuser `app_user` role + a per-transaction session variable carrying the caller's identity/scope + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Tested: a caller sees exactly the rows their group capability × folder scope allow.
- **A narrow system path** (running as the owner, RLS bypassed) is reserved for migrations, seeding, and first-user bootstrap (there are no groups yet when the first admin registers).
- **Footgun to respect:** superusers bypass RLS entirely. So exactly one narrow system path runs as the owner; everything else goes through the `app_user` wrapper. That boundary is the whole game.

### Two reference variants (preserve today's behavior)

Reference resolution already has two variants that the SQL must keep:
- **Folder children** → full predicate (type + mode + **path**).
- **Embedded assets** (e.g. the questions inside a dashboard you can open) → **type + mode only, no path scope** — they travel with their container. Applying the path predicate here would wrongly hide them.

So the by-id read carries *which variant* the caller needs (today's `file.type === 'folder'` branch, pushed down a layer).

## Milestones

Each milestone is gated by tests. **No behavior change until M3.** RLS (M1c) is optional hardening, sequenced *after* the feature works — it doesn't block anything before it.

### M1a — Resolver + predicate parity (zero behavior change)
Extract one effective-access resolver producing an `AccessPredicate` + in-memory `check()` that reproduces **today's exact behavior**, then route the existing gate through it.
- [ ] `AccessPredicate` contract + `resolveAccessPredicate(user)` + `check(file, predicate, variant)` (contracts first)
- [ ] Reproduce `canAccessFile`: type access (role + config `accessRules` overrides), mode isolation, admin bypass
- [ ] Reproduce non-admin path rules: home folder (excluding system subfolders), `/database`, own `/logs/conversations/{id}`, `/logs/runs`, ancestor-context access
- [ ] Reproduce the two reference variants (folder-child = full; embedded asset = type + mode only)
- [ ] Reproduce `canViewFileInUI` (adds `viewTypes`) + create/edit/delete rules (create types, create scope, creation/deletion blocklists, create-location restrictions)
- [ ] Characterization battery: {admin, editor, viewer, guest, impersonated} × {folder-child, embedded-ref, conversations, database, runs, ancestor-context, mode-isolation, create-blocklist, create-location} — confirm **red** against a stub, then green
- [ ] Route `files.server.ts` + `guest-session.ts` through `check()`; delete the duplicated logic; full suite + `validate` green

### M1b — SQL enforcement (zero behavior change)
- [ ] `AccessPredicate.toSql()` → parameterized `WHERE` / `EXISTS` fragment
- [ ] Thread the predicate through every `DocumentDB` read (`listAll`, `getById`, `getByIds`, `findByShareNonce`, counts) as a **required arg**; system queries pass an explicit bypass token
- [ ] Carry the reference variant into `getByIds` (folder vs embedded)
- [ ] Guarded writes: `INSERT … SELECT … WHERE` for create; predicate in `WHERE` for edit/delete/move; keep the app-side check only for the error message
- [ ] `text_pattern_ops` index on `path` (`postgres-schema.ts` + `update-workspace-template`)
- [ ] Parity assertion: SQL result set **===** `check()`-filtered set across the battery; full suite green; browser-verify key flows

### M1c — Transparent RLS *(optional hardening — gated on the timing decision)*
- [ ] Non-superuser `app_user` role + `GRANT`s (`postgres-schema.ts`)
- [ ] Per-transaction `SET LOCAL ROLE` + caller session var in the DB module
- [ ] Narrow system-bypass path (migrations, seeding, first-user bootstrap)
- [ ] Install the predicate as an RLS policy + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`; verify on PGLite **and** Postgres; test the superuser-bypass boundary

### M2 — Group model + seed + migration (zero behavior change checkpoint)
- [ ] Schema: `groups`, `group_scopes`, `group_members` — migration entry (v37) + `postgres-schema.ts` + `update-workspace-template`
- [ ] Types for `Group` / capability profile / scope
- [ ] Seed `Admin` (caps `*`, scope `*`, workspace-admin, **locked**) / `Editor` / `Viewer` from `rules.json`; `Editor`/`Viewer` scoped to `$HOME`
- [ ] Migrate every user → membership in the seed group matching their role; `home_folder` becomes their personal scope
- [ ] Resolver reads groups **live** + intrinsic grants (home folder, conversations); `isAdmin(user)` = in-admin-group; fold config `accessRules` overrides into seed capabilities
- [ ] Parity: behavior **identical** to pre-migration across the battery; full suite green

### M3 — Feature: custom groups + UX
Backend
- [ ] Group CRUD API (groups · members · folder scopes) — admin-gated
- [ ] Capability presets (View / Build / Full) + advanced type-matrix override
- [ ] Invariants: always ≥ 1 admin; `Admin` group not editable into a lockout; a group needs ≥ 1 scope

UI
- [ ] Group page — members · capability preset · folder rows (add-picker)
- [ ] Folder → access view ("who can see this folder")
- [ ] "Why does X have access?" affordance on a user
- [ ] User create/edit: assign group(s) + home folder
- [ ] Browser-verify + visual iteration

### Cross-cutting (verified throughout)
- [ ] Guest / public-share: predicate stays optional; guests covered by intrinsic scope; public sharing unbroken (explicit tests)
- [ ] Impersonation (`as_user`) path tested
- [ ] User-facing permissions doc

## Test strategy (Phase 1 is a security change — coverage is the safety)

Parity battery = **principals** {user, admin, **guest**, impersonated} × **variants** {folder-child, embedded-ref, conversation-folder, mode-isolation, create-blocklist}. Guest especially: guests have no group memberships, so the predicate must be **optional** (guests are covered only by their intrinsic scope) or public sharing breaks. Invariants: always ≥1 admin-capable member; the `Admin` group can't be edited into a lockout.

## Indexing

Prefix matching (`path LIKE '/x/%'`) needs a `text_pattern_ops` index on `path` — the existing plain btree (`idx_files_path`) does **not** accelerate `LIKE 'prefix%'` under the default collation. Declared in `postgres-schema.ts` as `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS … (path text_pattern_ops)` (self-applies on boot) + `npm run update-workspace-template`.
